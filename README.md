# PM2.5 component data

We have generated annual mean predictions for 15 PM2.5 components at a 50 m × 50 m spatial resolution in urban areas and a 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution in non-urban area: **zinc (Zn), vanadium (V), silicon (Si), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), potassium (K), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), calcium (Ca), bromine (Br), sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC)**. Specifically, we have collected daily mean PM2.5 component data from 987 monitoring sites across the United States. Hundreds of predictors were used for modeling, such as traffic counts, distance to OpenStreetMap features, satellite observations available through Google Earth Engine, chemical transport model simulations, and meteorological variables, amongst many others. We fitted six machine-learning algorithms to predict each component and integrated predictions using six super-learners and a GAM-based ensemble weighted-averaging model allowing the weights given to each model to vary geographically and nonlinearly. The super-learner with best performance was chosen as the final model, which varied by PM2.5 component. This approach yielded excellent model performance, with out of sample validation R2 for individual components ranging from 0.821 (Br) to 0.975 (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>).

These high-resolution predictions allow us to estimate ZIP Code-level component concentrations with a high degree of accuracy. For a general ZIP Code that has a normal street delivery route and therefore can be represented by a polygonal area, we estimate the ZIP Code-level concentrations by averaging the predictions of grid cells whose centroids lie inside the polygon of that ZIP Code; for the other ZIP Codes that do not have polygon representations, for example an apartment building, a military base, or a post office, we consider each of them as a single point and estimate their ZIP Code-level concentrations by assigning the predictions of the nearest grid cell.

For **Ec, Oc, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>** the units are **&micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>**. For **Br, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Ni, Pb, Si, V, and Z** the units are **ng/m<sup>3</sup>**.
